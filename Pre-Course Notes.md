# How to Complete AWS Academy Lab Exercises

## 🔧 Steps to Complete Lab Exercises

### 1. Start the Lab
- Click **Start Lab** to begin.
- A temporary AWS account is created and a timer starts.
- Wait for **"Lab status: ready"** before proceeding.
- Reset the timer anytime by clicking **Start Lab** again.

### 2. Access the AWS Console
- Click the **AWS** button to open the console in a new tab.
- You’ll be logged in with temporary credentials.

### 3. View Lab Details
- Click **Details** and then **Show** to view:
  - Remaining time
  - Service details (IP addresses, names)
  - SSH/CLI credentials

### 4. Lab Limits
- Some AWS services may be disabled if not required.
- Each lab has a **credit limit**:
  - Exceeding it disables your account and terminates services.
  - The limit is at least double what's needed to complete the lab.

### 5. End the Lab
- Click **End Lab** when finished.
- Termination may take up to 5 minutes.
- Labs can be repeated unless the credit limit is reached.
