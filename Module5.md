---

### Shared Responsibility Model (Focus Areas):
This module covers two key areas of the **Shared Responsibility Model**:

#### Customer Responsibilities:
- Security **in** the cloud:
  - Customer data
  - Platform, applications, IAM
  - OS, network, firewall configuration
  - Client-side encryption & data integrity
  - Authentication
  - Server-side encryption
  - Network traffic protection (encryption, integrity, identity)

#### AWS Responsibilities:
- Security **of** the cloud:
  - AWS foundational services (compute, storage, databases, networking)
  - AWS Global Infrastructure (Regions, Availability Zones, Edge Locations)


## Section 2: Protecting Data at Rest

### Overview:
This section explains the importance of protecting **data at rest** and outlines common threats and mitigation strategies using AWS services, particularly Amazon S3.

---

### Why Protect Data at Rest?
Encrypting data at rest ensures that even if unauthorized access occurs, the data remains secure. This is crucial for:

- Preventing **data breaches**
- Meeting **business** and **compliance** requirements
- Reducing the impact of **endpoint compromises**

---

### Common Threats & Mitigations:

| **Threat**                     | **Mitigation Strategy**                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Information Disclosure**     | - Limit user access using policies<br>- Encrypt confidential data                       |
| **Data Integrity Compromise**  | - Use resource permissions<br>- Implement digital signatures and encryption<br>- Restore from backup or previous S3 object version |
| **Accidental/Malicious Deletion** | - Apply least privilege principle<br>- Restore from backup or previous S3 object version |
| **System/Hardware/Software Failure** | - Restore data from replicas in case of failure or disaster                         |

---

### Amazon S3 Security Defaults:
- All **S3 resources** (buckets, objects, subresources) are **private by default**.
- Only the **resource owner** (creating AWS account) has access.
- Access can be granted using **access policies**.

> üîê **S3 Block Public Access**: An additional layer to prevent accidental data exposure.

---

### Access Control Mechanisms in Amazon S3:

#### 1. **Identity-Based Policies**
- Attached to **IAM users**
- Define what actions a user is allowed to perform

#### 2. **Resource-Based Policies**
- Attached directly to **resources** (e.g., S3 buckets, VPC endpoints, KMS keys)
- Define what actions specific users/accounts can perform on the resource

> üß† **Example**:  
> - Bob‚Äôs IAM policy allows `GET`, `PUT`, and `LIST` on Bucket X  
> - Bucket X‚Äôs resource policy allows only `GET` and `LIST`  
> - Result: Bob **cannot PUT** objects into Bucket X

#### 3. **Cross-Account Access**
- Use **resource-based policies** to grant access to other AWS accounts without using roles

---

### Access Control Lists (ACLs):
- ACLs are **independent** of IAM policies
- Mostly **deprecated** in modern use cases
- AWS recommends **disabling ACLs** unless object-level control is required
- With ACLs disabled, **bucket policies** become the sole access control mechanism

---

### Key Takeaways:
- üîê **Encrypting data at rest** enhances security against unauthorized access
- üõ°Ô∏è **Amazon S3 is private by default** and requires credentials for access
- üîß S3 supports two main access control types:
  - **Identity-based**
  - **Resource-based**

## Section 3: Amazon S3 Protection Features
__

### This section covers Amazon S3 protection features. 

Amazon S3 provides a number of security features to consider as you develop and implement your own security policies. Amazon S3 provides the Block Public Access feature to help you manage public access to S3 resources. By default, new buckets and objects don't allow public access, but users can modify bucket policies or object permissions to allow public access. S3 Block Public Access provides settings that override these policies and permissions so that you can limit public access to these resources.

This feature provides four settings:  
‚Ä¢ BlockPublicAcls: Prevent any new operations to make buckets or objects public through bucket or object ACLs. Existing policies and ACLs for buckets and objects are not modified.  
‚Ä¢ IgnorePublicAcls: Ignore all public ACLs on a bucket and any objects that it contains.  
‚Ä¢ BlockPublicPolicy: Reject calls to PUT a bucket policy if the specified bucket policy allows public access. (Enabling this setting doesn't affect existing bucket policies.)  
‚Ä¢ RestrictPublicBuckets: Restrict access to a bucket with a public policy to only AWS services and authorized users within the bucket owner's account.

These settings are independent and can be used in any combination. You can apply each setting to an access point, a bucket, or an entire AWS account. You cannot apply these settings on a per-object basis. If the block public access settings for the access point, bucket, or account differ, then Amazon S3 applies the most restrictive combination of the access point, bucket, and account settings.

When Amazon S3 receives a request to access a bucket or an object, the service determines whether the bucket or the bucket owner's account has a block public access setting applied. If an existing block public access setting prohibits the requested access, Amazon S3 rejects the request.

In addition to these settings, the Amazon S3 console highlights your publicly accessible buckets, indicates the source of public accessibility, and also warns you if changes to your bucket policies or bucket ACLs would make your bucket publicly accessible.

For more information, see Blocking Public Access to Your Amazon S3 Storage in the Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide.
---

Another security feature to consider is Versioning. It is a method of keeping multiple variants of an object in the same bucket. With this feature, you can preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored in your buckets. By default, S3 Versioning is disabled on buckets, and you must explicitly enable it.

Versioning can help you to recover objects from accidental deletion or overwrite. For example, if you delete an object, instead of removing it permanently, Amazon S3 inserts a delete marker, which becomes the current object version. You can always restore the previous version. Overwriting an object results in a new object version in the bucket, but you can always restore the previous version.

With versioning enabled, the most recently written version will be retrieved by default. You can retrieve older versions of an object by specifying the version in your request.

To customize your data retention approach and control storage costs, use object versioning with S3 Lifecycle.

After you enable versioning for a bucket, you can't return it to an unversioned state. You can, however, suspend versioning on a bucket, which stops accruing new versions of the same object in a bucket. You might do this because you only want a single version of an object in a bucket. Or, you might not want to accrue charges for multiple versions. When you suspend versioning, existing objects in your bucket do not change.

When working with S3 Versioning in Amazon S3 buckets, you can optionally add another layer of security by enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) delete. When you do this, the bucket owner must include two forms of authentication in any request to delete a version or change the versioning state of the bucket.

For more information, see Using Versioning in S3 Buckets in the Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide.
---

Finally, with Object Lock, you can store objects by using a write-once-read-many (WORM) model. This feature provides protection for scenarios where it's imperative that data is not changed or deleted. The feature can provide protection for a fixed amount of time or indefinitely. You can use Object Lock to meet regulatory requirements that require WORM storage, or add an extra layer of protection against object changes and deletion.

Note that Object Lock works only in versioned buckets.

Object Lock provides two ways to manage object retention: retention periods and legal holds.  
- A **retention period** specifies a fixed period during which an object remains locked. During this period, your object is WORM-protected and can't be overwritten or deleted.  
- A **legal hold** provides the same protection as a retention period but has no expiration date. Instead, a legal hold remains in place until you explicitly remove it.

You can configure Object Lock in one of two modes:  
- **Governance mode**: Users can't overwrite or delete an object version or alter its lock settings unless they have special permissions.  
- **Compliance mode**: A protected object version can't be overwritten or deleted by any user, including the root user in your AWS account.

For more information, see How S3 Object Lock Works in the Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide.

---

### Key takeaways from this section of the module include the following:  
‚Ä¢ Block Public Access ensures that objects never have public access, now and in the future.  
‚Ä¢ Versioning preserves, retrieves, and restores every version of every object stored in an S3 bucket.  
‚Ä¢ Object Lock prevents an object version from being deleted or overwritten for a fixed amount of time or indefinitely.

---
## Section 4: Encryption in AWS

### Client-Side Encryption

Client-side encryption takes place before data is submitted to AWS, and decryption occurs after data is retrieved from AWS. Amazon S3 receives your encrypted data but does not play a role in encrypting or decrypting it.

To enable client-side encryption, you can use a key stored in AWS KMS or use a key that you store within your application.

AWS supports client-side encryption libraries such as the AWS Encryption SDK, Amazon DynamoDB Encryption Client, and Amazon S3 encryption clients.

---

### Server-Side Encryption

Server-side encryption is the encryption of data at its destination by the application or service that receives it.

With AWS server-side encryption, your source data comes from systems in your data center or an EC2 instance. You can upload that data over an HTTPS connection to any of the AWS services that support automatic server-side encryption. The service endpoint will handle the encryption and key management processes for you.

With Amazon S3, encryption is an optional step that you specify when you upload your data to the service.

---

### Server-Side Encryption Options in Amazon S3

For server-side encryption in Amazon S3, you have three mutually exclusive options, depending on how you choose to manage the encryption keys:

#### SSE with customer-provided keys (SSE-C)

With server-side encryption with customer-provided keys (SSE-C), you manage the encryption keys. With the encryption key that you provide as part of the request, Amazon S3 manages the encryption (as it writes to disks) and decryption (when you access your objects). You don't maintain the code to perform data encryption and decryption‚Äîyou only maintain the keys.

Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key that you provide. Instead, a randomly salted hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) value of the encryption key is stored to validate future requests. The salted HMAC value cannot be used to derive the value of the encryption key or decrypt the contents of the encrypted object. So, if you lose the encryption key, you lose the object.

#### SSE with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3)

When you use server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3), each object is encrypted with a unique key. As an additional safeguard, Amazon S3 encrypts the key itself with a key that the service regularly rotates. SSE-S3 uses one of the strongest block ciphers available, 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256), to encrypt your data.

#### SSE with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS)

Server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS) is similar to SSE-S3 but with some additional benefits and charges for using the service. There are separate permissions for the use of a KMS key that provide added protection against unauthorized access of your objects in Amazon S3.

SSE-KMS also provides you with an audit trail that shows when your KMS key was used and by whom. Additionally, you can create and manage customer managed KMS keys or use AWS managed KMS keys that are unique to you, your service, and your Region.

AWS KMS uses envelope encryption to further protect your data. Envelope encryption is the practice of encrypting your plaintext data with a data key and then encrypting that data key with a root key.

---

### SSE-KMS Encryption Workflow

#### Uploading a File to Amazon S3

1. You request to upload a file and store it as an encrypted object in an S3 bucket.  
2. Amazon S3 requests a data key from AWS KMS to use to encrypt the file.  
3. AWS KMS generates a plaintext data key and encrypts the data key by using the customer managed key.  
4. AWS KMS sends both copies of the data key to Amazon S3.  
5. Amazon S3 encrypts the object by using the plaintext data key, stores the object, and then deletes the plaintext data key. The encrypted key is kept in the object metadata.

#### Opening an Encrypted Object in Amazon S3

1. You request to open the object.  
2. Amazon S3 notices that the requested object is encrypted.  
3. Amazon S3 sends the encrypted copy of the data key that the object is encrypted with to AWS KMS.  
4. AWS KMS then decrypts the data key by using the customer managed key (which never leaves the AWS KMS service).  
5. AWS KMS then sends the plaintext data key back to Amazon S3.  
6. Finally, Amazon S3 decrypts the ciphertext of the data object, allows you to open the object, and deletes the plaintext copy of the data key.

---

### AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)

AWS KMS is a managed service that provides the ability to create and control the keys that are used to encrypt your data.

You can:
- Create data keys with unique aliases and descriptions for better management  
- Automatically rotate your keys on a scheduled basis  
- Disable or delete keys so that no one can use them  
- Import your own keys instead of using AWS generated keys

The service uses FIPS 140-2 validated hardware security modules (HSMs) to protect keys.

AWS KMS is integrated with other AWS services to help you protect the data that you store with these services. Integrated AWS services use envelope encryption to help protect your encryption keys.

With AWS KMS, you can centrally manage and securely store your keys. You can use the keys within your applications and supported AWS Cloud services to protect your data, but the keys never leave AWS KMS. This reduces the risk of having your data key compromised.

You submit data to AWS KMS to be encrypted or decrypted under keys that you control. You can set usage policies on these keys to determine which users can use them.

All requests to use these keys are logged in AWS CloudTrail, so that you can understand who used which key and when. CloudTrail logs all AWS KMS operations, including read-only operations; operations that manage KMS keys; and cryptographic operations.

> For more information, see the following resources:  
> - AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) at https://aws.amazon.com/kms/
> - How AWS Services Use AWS KMS in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/service-integration.html

---

### Amazon EBS Encryption

Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) encryption is a straight-forward encryption solution for EBS resources that are associated with your EC2 instances. With Amazon EBS encryption, you aren't required to build, maintain, and secure your own key management infrastructure.

Amazon EBS encryption uses KMS keys when creating encrypted volumes and snapshots. Each volume is encrypted using AES-256-XTS. This requires two 256-bit keys, which you can think of as one 512-bit key. The data key is encrypted under a KMS key in your account.

For Amazon EBS to encrypt a volume for you, it must have access to a customer managed key in the account. You do this by providing a grant for Amazon EBS to the customer managed key to create data keys, and to encrypt and decrypt these data keys.

The following are the basic steps to encrypt and decrypt EBS volume data:

1. Amazon EBS obtains an encrypted data key under a customer managed key through AWS KMS and stores the encrypted key with the encrypted data.  
2. The servers that host EC2 instances retrieve the encrypted data key from storage.  
3. A call is made to AWS KMS over TLS to decrypt the encrypted data key. AWS KMS identifies the KMS key, makes an internal request to an HSM in the fleet to decrypt the data key, and returns the key to the customer over the TLS session.  
4. The decrypted data key is stored in memory and used to encrypt and decrypt all data going to and from the attached EBS volume. Amazon EBS retains the encrypted data key for later use in case the data key in memory is no longer available.

---

### Key Takeaways

- AWS supports both client-side and server-side encryption.  
- **CSE**: You encrypt your data before sending it to AWS.  
- **SSE**: AWS encrypts data on your behalf after receiving it.  
- AWS provides three types of SSE:  
  ‚Ä¢ SSE with customer-provided keys (SSE-C)  
  ‚Ä¢ SSE with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3)  
  ‚Ä¢ SSE with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS)  
- AWS KMS can create and control the keys used to encrypt your data.

## Section 5: Protecting Data in Transit

### Overview

This section covers how to protect data in transit.

Data in transit is data that is actively moving from one location to another, such as across the internet or through a private network. To protect data in transit, you protect data while it's traveling from network to network or being transferred from a local storage device to a cloud storage device. Wherever data is moving, protection measures are critical, as data is often considered less secure while in motion.

Cloud applications often communicate over public links, such as the internet, so it's important to protect data in transit when you run applications in the cloud. This involves protecting network traffic between clients and servers, and network traffic between servers.

While being transferred through various applications and networks, data in transit is exposed to the following risks:  
‚Ä¢ Accidental information disclosures  
‚Ä¢ Data integrity compromises  
‚Ä¢ Identity compromises  
‚Ä¢ Man-in-middle (MITM) attacks  
‚Ä¢ Identity spoofing  

A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack is a form of cyberattack in which criminals exploit weak web-based protocols to insert themselves between entities in a communication channel to steal data. The attacker is in the middle of ongoing communication between two entities. This type of attack makes the network vulnerable to packet sniffing and modification.

---

### Protection Methods

You can protect data in transit by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or client-side encryption. You can securely upload your data to or download it from Amazon S3 through SSL endpoints by using the HTTPS protocol. Client-side encryption will protect your data in transit because the data is encrypted before you send it to Amazon S3.

You can also limit access to an S3 bucket from a specific Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) endpoint or a set of endpoints by using S3 bucket policies.

To protect data in transit, AWS encourages customers to use a multi-level approach.  
- All network traffic between AWS data centers is transparently encrypted at the physical layer.  
- All traffic within a VPC and between peered VPCs across AWS Regions is transparently encrypted at the network layer when using supported EC2 instance types.  
- At the application layer, customers have a choice about whether and how to use encryption by using a protocol such as Transport Layer Security (TLS).  
- All AWS service endpoints support TLS to create a secure HTTPS connection to make API requests.

---

### Secure Access Protocols

Users who access Windows Terminal Services in the public cloud usually use the Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). By default, RDP connections establish an underlying SSL/TLS connection. For optimal protection, the Windows server being accessed should be issued a trusted X.509 certificate to protect from identity spoofing or man-in-the-middle attacks. By default, Windows RDP servers use self-signed certificates, which are not trusted and should be avoided.

Secure Shell (SSH) is the preferred approach to establish administrative connections to Linux servers. SSH is a protocol that, like SSL, provides a secure communications channel between the client and server. SSH supports tunneling, which you should use to run applications such as X-Windows on top of SSH and to protect the application session in transit.

By default, Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) that AWS and most vendors from the AWS Marketplace provide don't allow the root user to log in from an SSH terminal. The default configuration for AWS provided AMIs is logging in with an SSH key pair with password authentication deactivated.

---

### AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)

By making it easy to enable SSL/TLS, AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) helps organizations to meet regulatory and compliance requirements for encryption of data in transit. ACM handles the complexity of creating and managing public SSL/TLS certificates for your AWS based websites and applications.

You can also use ACM to issue private SSL/TLS X.509 certificates that identify users, computers, applications, services, servers, and other devices internally.

ACM provides a single interface for you to manage both public and private certificates. With ACM, you can easily create and deploy public and private certificates for your on-premises resources, such as internal servers and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. You can also deploy private or public certificates on AWS resources, such as load balancers, Amazon CloudFront distributions, and Amazon API Gateway endpoints by using the AWS Management Console or the ACM API.

ACM is also designed to protect and manage private certificates. The service can also help you minimize downtime due to misconfigured or expired certificates. ACM helps manage the challenges of maintaining certificates, including certificate renewals so that you don‚Äôt have to worry about outages that result from expiring certificates.

Renewed certificates are deployed automatically on AWS resources.

---

### ACM Private Certificate Authority

By using AWS Certificate Manager Private Certificate Authority, you can create private certificate authority (CA) hierarchies, including root and subordinate CAs, without the investment and maintenance costs of operating an on-premises CA.

Your private CAs can issue end-entity X.509 certificates, which are useful in scenarios such as the following:  
‚Ä¢ Creating encrypted TLS communication channels  
‚Ä¢ Authenticating users, computers, API endpoints, and IoT devices  
‚Ä¢ Cryptographically signing code  
‚Ä¢ Implementing Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) to obtain certificate revocation status

ACM Private CA is for enterprise customers who are building a public key infrastructure (PKI) inside the AWS Cloud. The service is intended for private use within an organization.

With ACM Private CA, you can create your own CA hierarchy and issue certificates with it to authenticate internal users, computers, applications, services, servers, and other devices, and to sign computer code. Certificates that a private CA issues are trusted only within your organization, not on the internet.

After creating a private CA, you have the ability to issue certificates directly (that is, without obtaining validation from a third-party CA) and to customize them to meet your organization's internal needs.

---

### ACM Private CA Workflow

The diagram shows ACM Private CA in action:

1. The CA administrator creates a subordinate CA to issue certificates.  
2. The subordinate CA sends the certificate to be signed.  
3. The on-premises CA or AWS CA signs the certificate.  
4. ACM Private CA issues the signed certificate to resources.

---

### ACM Private CA Security Features

ACM Private CA is secured with HSMs. These HSMs adhere to FIPS 140-2 Level 3 security standards to help protect your private CA against key compromises.

CA administrators can also control access to the service by using IAM policies.

ACM Private CA publishes and updates certificate revocation lists to an S3 bucket automatically to help prevent the use of revoked certificates. For instance, an IoT application can check if the private certificate for a sensor is valid before accepting data from the sensor.

ACM Private CA also creates another S3 bucket that provides the ability to generate audit reports.

Securing internal services is a common use case for ACM Private CA. For example, a private certificate is useful to secure connections to your load balancers, API endpoints, applications, and internal Wi-Fi.

This service is also an infrastructure component of ACM, which has a wide variety of uses of its own. Examples include managing private certificates with the benefit of managed renewals and certificate binding, and issuing private certificates to identify AWS resources, such as EC2 instances, Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) messages, or IoT devices.

ACM Private CA also works well for customers who want a replacement for self-signed certificates and automation through APIs.

---

### Key Takeaways

 - Protect data in transit by using SSL or client-side encryption when you run applications in the cloud.
 - Use VPC endpoints to limit access to S3 buckets.
 - The ACM service handles the complexity of creating and managing public SSL/TLS certificates for your AWS based websites and applications.
 - ACM Private CA can manage the lifecycle of your private certificates centrally and in a highly available way.

## Section 6: Best Practices to Protect Data in Amazon S3

### Overview

This section covers best practices to protect data in Amazon S3.

All objects in an S3 bucket are private by default. Only the object owner has permissions to access these objects. However, the object owner can optionally share objects with others by creating a presigned URL, using their own security credentials, to grant time-limited permissions to upload or download the objects.

A presigned URL provides temporary access to a specific S3 object. By using the URL, a user can either read, write, or update the object. For example, if you have a video in your bucket and both the bucket and the video are private, you can share the video with others by generating a presigned URL.

Similarly, if you want to receive an object from a user without an AWS account, they can upload an object by using a presigned URL that you share with them.

For more information, see Generating a Presigned URL to Upload an Object

---

### Recommended Best Practices

To ensure that you provide the correct balance of security and operational flexibility, AWS recommends the following best practices when using Amazon S3:

- Use encryption as an additional access control to complement the identity, resource, and network-oriented access controls already described. AWS provides a number of features that can help you to easily encrypt data and manage the keys. All AWS services offer the ability to encrypt data at rest and in transit.
- Use bucket policies along with IAM policies to protect resources from unauthorized access and to prevent information disclosure, data integrity compromise, or deletion.
- Set IAM and bucket policies with the least privileges. For example, if an application is expected to upload objects, then the respective IAM role should not have read permissions for the object or any other permissions.
- Enable MFA delete for versioning-enabled buckets to ensure that files cannot be removed or tampered with.
- Enforce SSE for each PUT request. This would lead to a deny in cases where the end user doesn‚Äôt request SSE.
- Use presigned URLs for applications that refer to S3 objects with anonymous access; for example, downloading restricted content. Authentication and authorization must be done in the application.

---

### Additional Best Practices

The following are additional best practices when using Amazon S3:

- Set default encryption on a bucket if you want all objects to be encrypted once stored in the bucket.
- While using S3 Object Lock, use the appropriate retention mode (governance mode or compliance mode). These retention modes apply different levels of protection to your objects. You can apply either retention mode to any object version that is protected by S3 Object Lock.
- Use S3 Block Public Access settings to enforce that buckets don't allow public access to data.
- Upload data to Amazon S3 over SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) by using AWS Transfer for SFTP. This fully managed service provides file transfer over SFTP directly in and out of Amazon S3. Using this service eliminates the need for you to manage SFTP-related infrastructure.
- With the data in Amazon S3, you can easily integrate it into workloads that use a broad array of AWS services.
- Use S3 Versioning to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored in your S3 bucket.

## Section 7: Additional Data Protection Services

### Overview

This section provides information about additional services that can help you to protect your data.

---

### AWS Secrets Manager

AWS Secrets Manager is a service that makes it easier for you to manage secrets. Secrets can be database credentials, passwords, third-party API keys, and even arbitrary text. You can store and control access to these secrets centrally by using the console, AWS CLI, or API and SDKs.

With Secrets Manager, you can remove hard-coded credentials (including passwords) from your source code and avoid storing credentials in a configuration file. Instead, you use an API call to Secrets Manager to retrieve the secret programmatically. This helps ensure that the secret can't be compromised by someone examining your code, because the secret simply isn't there.

Also, you can configure Secrets Manager to automatically rotate the secret for you according to a schedule that you specify. Therefore, you can replace long-term secrets with short-term ones, which helps to significantly reduce the risk of compromise.

---

### Secrets Manager Workflow Example

This diagram shows how to use Secrets Manager to secure database credentials. The approach uses an AWS Lambda function, which uses credentials from Secrets Manager to connect to and query the backend Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) database. This is done without hardcoding the secrets in code or passing them through environment variables. This approach helps you secure last-mile secrets and protect your backend databases.

The steps in this workflow are as follows:

1. Clients call the RESTful API hosted on Amazon API Gateway.  
2. API Gateway runs the Lambda function.  
3. The Lambda function retrieves the database secrets using the Secrets Manager API. Secrets Manager retrieves the secret, decrypts the protected secret text, and returns it to the function over a secured channel.  
4. The Lambda function connects to the Amazon RDS database by using database secrets from Secrets Manager and returns the query results.

For more information, see How to Securely Provide Database Credentials to Lambda Functions by Using AWS Secrets Manager

---

### Secrets Manager Rotation

With Secrets Manager, you can automatically rotate passwords for Amazon Aurora, MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, and Oracle databases that are hosted on AWS. To turn on automatic rotation, you need administrator permissions.

This rotation is done without human intervention through a Lambda function, either on a schedule that you specify or as needed. For Amazon RDS DB engine credentials, this Lambda function already exists, but if you have other credentials with an expiration, such as a SAML login, you might want to create a custom function for use with Secrets Manager.

The rotation function does the work of rotating the secret. The process to rotate a secret has four steps, which correspond to four steps in the Lambda rotation function. Secrets Manager uses staging labels to label secret versions during rotation:

1. The function contacts the DB for new credentials.  
2. Secrets Manager stores the new credentials with the `AWSPENDING` label.  
3. The new credentials are tested.  
4. The new credentials are made the default with the `AWSCURRENT` label.

---

### Amazon Macie

Amazon Macie is a security service that uses machine learning to automatically discover, classify, and protect sensitive data in AWS. Macie recognizes personally identifiable information (PII) such as passport numbers, medical ID numbers, and tax ID numbers. Macie also recognizes financial information, encryption keys, and credentials.

Macie also provides you the ability to add custom-defined data types using regular expressions to enable Macie to discover proprietary or unique sensitive data for your business.

Currently, Macie protects data stored in Amazon S3 only and is available in most AWS Regions. Macie has dashboards and alerts that give visibility into data access by analyzing Amazon S3 resource-based policies and ACLs during sensitive data recovery. The service continuously monitors data and generates detailed alerts when it detects risk of unauthorized access or inadvertent data leaks.

With Macie, you have full control of the service through the Macie API set, and you can centrally manage Macie for multiple accounts. Macie integrates with AWS Organizations, which means that you can manage as many as 5,000 Macie accounts for a single AWS organization. You can also continue to use native Macie features for managing multiple accounts, which enables you to manage as many as 1,000 member accounts with a single Macie administrator account.

### Macie Discovery and Monitoring

Macie can help you classify your sensitive and business-critical data at the S3 bucket level. Macie scans all supported objects found and evaluates them for sensitive data that meets the job criteria. You can further configure these sensitive data discovery jobs; for example, only classify PDF documents or classify all objects except those with a particular prefix.

By default, Macie will continuously monitor all buckets in any account in which it is enabled. Findings are generated for any bucket that is public, not encrypted, or shared or replicated with AWS accounts outside of a customer‚Äôs organization. These findings are reported in near-real time.

The Macie summary page in the console provides an overview of the buckets that have been through the Macie discovery process. As mentioned, buckets are monitored for allowing public access, not being encrypted, and being shared or replicated outside of your account.

A Macie job analyzes data in specific S3 buckets for sensitive data. Each job uses managed data identifiers that Macie provides and, optionally, custom data identifiers that you create. The service provides the ability to run one-time, daily, weekly, or monthly sensitive data discovery jobs for all or a subset of objects in an S3 bucket. For sensitive data discovery jobs, Macie automatically tracks changes to the bucket and only evaluates new or modified objects over time.
